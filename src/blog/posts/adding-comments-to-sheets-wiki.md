I've added comments via [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/). This infrastructure is independent from the CMS; however, I think it provides an interesting path forward for content editing on this site.

Ideally, all authentication would be integrated while also not being dependent on services like Netlify Identity. However, this solution seems to be functional for now, so I've decided to go with it until I can figure out a stronger, independent system.

Let me know your thoughts below or on Discord. I'll provide further updates on authentication as I work on it.
