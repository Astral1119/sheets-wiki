Functions are the building blocks of formulae. They take the form `function_name(argument)`. Arguments are inputs to the function: essentially, they give the function all the information it needs to complete a calculation. Proper use of functions requires that you understand why the function needs each argument, and thus what information you need to give it. This is most easily done by referring to the [documentation](https://support.google.com/docs/table/25273?hl=en).

Understanding how functions work and which ones to use is the first large barrier to effective formuale. Establishing a vocabulary of functions takes time, effort, and practice.
