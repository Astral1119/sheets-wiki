The way different types of data are handled in Google Sheets may seem abstruse to the layman. To those well-versed in JavaScript, the typing is functionally the same—but even then, there are idiosyncratic differences, such as data structures and date handling.

Spreadsheets are fundamentally a data-oriented tool, so strong insight into how data types work is very important. This book goes over each types’ properties, conversion between types, and more. It will also discuss proper data structuring and give insight into how spreadsheets should be formatted.
