Perhaps the simplest data type, [Booleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type) can only ever be `TRUE` or `FALSE`. They are key to logic within formulae.

Other data types are capable of emulating Booleans under the right conditions. We call these values [‘truthy’ and ‘falsy,’](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) as although they are not true Booleans, they function similarly.

When used in mathematical operations, Booleans will turn into numbers—`TRUE` becomes `1`, `FALSE` becomes `0`. When used in string operations, Booleans will simply turn into text versions of themselves (i.e. `TRUE` becomes `“TRUE”`).

Checkboxes will correspond with Boolean values by default.
