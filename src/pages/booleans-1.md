Booleans are `TRUE` or `FALSE`. They are key to logic within formulae.

Other data types are capable of emulating Booleans under the right conditions, following [‘truthy’](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) and [‘falsy’](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy)-ness.

Checkboxes will correspond with Boolean values by default.
