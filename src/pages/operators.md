Operators are a subset of [functions](https://sheets.wiki/books/functions/) that can be represented by different characters, and deviate from the standard notation; unlike normal functions, operators generally separate their arguments using the form `argument operator argument`. For example, the `MULTIPLY` function can also be represented using the `*` operator. Thus, `MULTIPLY(3,5)` is functionally the same as `3 * 5`.

If a function has an operator, generally speaking, you will only ever see the operator. If an operator exists, there is rarely a reason to use the function behind it.

This is a relatively minor distinction, but it is worth noting as it is common terminology.
