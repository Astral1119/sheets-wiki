T﻿his wiki is the successor to an earlier project, [docs.astral.cafe](https://docs.astral.cafe/).

W﻿hile it functioned quite well, community contributions were difficult as it required knowledge of `git`, which was a barrier to access that prevented many from making additions or revisions. As such, sheets.wiki aims to solve this issue through the use of a Content Management System, or CMS. It allows users to make contributions through their browsers. Here's what it looks like for me while creating this post:

However, this project is still very much incomplete. There's a pretty long list of to-dos, including porting over features from my old site and updating the identity backend to be open and tiered. Eventually, I'd like to switch away from Netlify Identity, since it limits how many users can contribute.

T﻿here's clearly a lot of work to be done, but I'm pretty optimistic about the future. I think there's a lot of potential for a good wiki; we just have to make it.

F﻿or the more technically-minded, this project uses [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/), [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
